          Hi, I’m Ahmed, a second-year Software Engineering student at ESSTHS
          with a strong passion for full-stack web development and continuous
          learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have solid experience with <strong> HTML</strong>,
          <strong> CSS</strong> , <strong> JavaScript</strong>,
          <strong> Bootstrap</strong>, <strong> PHP </strong>, and
          <strong> MySQL </strong>, which I applied in a real-world car rental
          website project. I’ve also built personal projects using
          <strong> React.js </strong> and am currently self-learning back-end
          development with <strong> Node.js </strong>,<strong> Express </strong>
          ,<strong> PostgreSQL</strong>, and
          <strong> MySQL </strong> through practical projects, including those
          from The Odin Project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy solving problems, continuously learning new technologies, and
          collaborating with others to build impactful software.
        </p>
